# API Project: File Metadata Microservice 

###    User stories:
1. I can submit a form that includes a file upload.
2. The from file input field  has the "name" attribute set to "upfile". We rely on this in testing.
3. When I submit something, I will receive the file name and size in bytes within the JSON response

### Usage :
* Go to the main page, and upload a file using the provided form.
